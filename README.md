# Operating-Platforms

# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements.
The client The Gaming Room is looking to expand their market from their already successful game on the Android platform by making it available across other platforms and devices.


# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I felt I did well providing insiteful solutions for their current needs with future needs in mind. They will need the opportunity to build and grow by using the best language to develop their web-based application and servers to best handle it for the client as well as their consumers.


# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
What I found most helpful while working through the design document would be the amount of research that I did to learn more about the oeprating systems I was previously unfamiliar with. Working with all the steps in the process helped by keeping it engaging as I directly applied what was learned to a real scenario. 


# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would choose to go more in depth with the various operating systems as I've done more reading on all of them I feel like I could provide more insight into their strengths and weaknesses for the server-side, client-side, and development of the game. 


# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The user's needs are one of the most important aspects to consider when devloping an application as they determine how successful it will be. An application that is low quality and isn't user friendly won't do as well and taking the user experience into account throughout the developemnt is a very important method. I provided the strengths from the user's side that different platforms provide to will avoid issues with user experience. 


# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
To design software start with an outline of functionality and how it should work before going into the details. Make sure to include the most important parts of how the program will need to work and break it down to see what needs to be done to achieve this. Address all technical requirements in the beginning then it comes together throughout the design and development of the architecture.
